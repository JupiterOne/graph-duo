# Integration with JupiterOne

## Setup

JupiterOne provides a managed integration for Duo. The integration connects
directly to Duo REST APIs to obtain configuration metadata and analyze resource
relationships.

You will need to create an API key (`integration key` + `secret key`) from your
Duo Admin Panel. You may need to contact Duo Support to request API access. See
instructions in [Duo Support Docs][1].

Configure JupiterOne Duo integration with the `api hostname`, `integration key`,
and `secret key`.
